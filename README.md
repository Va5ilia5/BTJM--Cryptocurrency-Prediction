# Cryptocurrency Prediction

Due to COVID-19, an exponential increase in new cryptocurrency traders, this project will focus on evaluating and forecasting the potential of cryptocurrency if COVID-19 had not occurred, as well as predicting the future of cryptocurrency post COVID-19.

We will focus on analyzing and predicting the 6 cryptocurrencies that blew up during COVID-19:

- Bitcoin (BTC)
- Ethereum (ETH)
- Dogecoin (DOGE)
- Dash (DASH)
- Ripple (XRP)
- Litecoin (LTC)


### The following are some of the data techniques I used in the project:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning
- Data Mining
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions
- Linear regression

### Technical Skills utilized
- Python
- Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
- Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Microsoft Excel
- Jupyter Notebooks
